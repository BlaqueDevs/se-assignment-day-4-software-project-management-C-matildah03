## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
The Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach to software development. It consists of distinct phases that must be completed one after the other, with little to no overlap. The typical phases include requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance while Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, promote adaptive planning and encourage rapid delivery of functional software.
    **Advantages of Waterfall**
Structured Approach:
The clear, linear structure makes it easy to understand and manage. Each phase has specific deliverables and milestones.
Well-Defined Requirements:
Requirements are gathered at the beginning of the project, which can lead to a clear understanding of what needs to be built.
Easy to Manage:
The sequential nature allows for straightforward project management and tracking of progress.
Predictable Timelines and Costs:
Since the scope is defined upfront, it can be easier to estimate timelines and budgets.
      **Disadvantages of Waterfall**
Inflexibility:
Once a phase is completed, it is challenging to go back and make changes. This rigidity can be problematic if requirements evolve.
Late Testing:
Testing occurs only after implementation, which can lead to discovering significant issues late in the process, making them more costly to fix.
Assumes Stability:
Waterfall assumes that requirements will not change, which is often unrealistic in dynamic environments.
Customer Involvement:
Limited customer involvement after the initial requirements phase can lead to a final product that does not meet user needs.

    **Advantages of Agile**
Flexibility and Adaptability:
Agile allows for changes in requirements even late in the development process, making it suitable for projects where user needs may evolve.
Frequent Delivery:
Agile promotes the delivery of small, incremental updates, allowing users to see progress and provide feedback regularly.
